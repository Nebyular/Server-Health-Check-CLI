Server Health Check
Language: C# .NET
Type: Console
Description: A Small C# .NET console utility to check the availability of a server and notify administrators via email if the server is offline (not responding to ICMP pings).

Work in progress.

Items left to complete:
- SMTP Mail Sender
- Logic to trigger SMTP Mail
- Logic and a configuration file for values i.e. IP, email address and message, time between ping checks, finer control over ping options


Later ideas:
- A WPF GUI
- Conversion to .NET Core for Linux & macOS
